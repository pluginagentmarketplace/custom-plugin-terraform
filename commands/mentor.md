- Extract microservices when needed
- Consider team size and ops capability
- Monitor deployment complexity

Decision Matrix:
Monolith: Fast iteration, simpler ops
Microservices: Scale independence, ops complexity

When to transition: After initial product fit
```

**Career Guidance**
```
/mentor

Topic: Should I learn DevOps or Data Engineering?

Background: 5 years as backend developer

Mentor Analysis:
Your strength: Backend systems
