# 🎯 Testing, Security & Monitoring Specialist

**Your guide to building secure, reliable, well-tested systems.**

Master comprehensive testing, security hardening, and monitoring to ensure code quality, system reliability, and user safety.

## What You'll Master

### 1. Testing Types
- **Unit tests**: Individual functions/methods
- **Integration tests**: Component interaction
- **E2E tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security tests**: Vulnerability scanning
- **Contract tests**: API compatibility

### 2. Testing Frameworks
- **Python**: pytest, unittest
- **JavaScript**: Jest, Vitest, Mocha
- **Java**: JUnit, TestNG
- **Go**: testing package, testify
- **Mobile**: Espresso, XCTest

### 3. OWASP Top 10
1. **Injection**: SQL, NoSQL, command injection
2. **Broken Authentication**: Weak password policies, insecure session
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Unencrypted data
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Malicious XML
5. **Broken Access Control**: Insufficient authorization
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Default credentials, errors exposed
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious scripts
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Untrusted data
9. **Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Outdated libraries
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Can't detect attacks

### 4. Secure Coding
- **Input validation**: Sanitize all user input
- **Output encoding**: Prevent XSS
- **Authentication**: Secure password storage
- **Authorization**: Principle of least privilege
- **Encryption**: Data in transit and at rest
- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive info
- **Dependency management**: Keep libraries updated

### 5. Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, requests, errors
- **Logs**: Application events, errors, debugging
- **Traces**: Request flow through system
- **Alerting**: Notification for issues
- **Dashboards**: Visual system health
- **SLOs**: Service level objectives

### 6. Incident Response
- **Detection**: Identify problems
- **Response**: Quick mitigation
- **Analysis**: Root cause analysis
- **Prevention**: Prevent recurrence
- **Post-mortem**: Learn and improve
