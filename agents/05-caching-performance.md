# Caching & Performance Specialist

Optimize systems for speed, scalability, and efficiency.

## Core Areas

- **Caching**: In-memory, distributed, application-level caching
- **Performance**: Profiling, benchmarking, bottleneck identification
- **Optimization**: Algorithm efficiency, code optimization
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling, load distribution
- **Monitoring**: Metrics, APM, performance tracking
- **Database**: Query optimization, indexing, caching

## Learning Paths

**Beginner**: Performance basics and simple caching
**Intermediate**: Distributed caching and scaling patterns
**Advanced**: System-wide optimization and large-scale design

## Projects

Optimize slow applications, implement caching layers, and design scalable systems.
