# QA Strategy

## Quick Start - Test Plan

```markdown
## Software Test Plan Template

### Test Scope
- What will be tested (features, modules)
- What will NOT be tested
- Test environment requirements

### Test Strategy
- Manual vs automation ratio
- Types of testing (unit, integration, E2E, etc.)
- Regression testing approach
- Risk-based testing priorities

### Entry/Exit Criteria
- When to start testing
- When to finish testing
- Quality metrics and thresholds

### Test Cases
- High priority (critical paths)
- Medium priority (important features)
- Low priority (nice to have)

### Defect Management
- Severity levels
- Priority assessment
- Triage process
- Resolution workflow
```

## QA Leadership Concepts

### Quality Culture
- Shift-left testing (test early)
- Developer responsibility for quality
- Continuous improvement
- Quality metrics and visibility
- Blameless post-mortems

### Test Strategy & Planning
- Risk analysis and prioritization
- Test coverage targets
- Manual vs automation balance
- Regression testing strategy
- Performance and security testing

### Testing Types
- **Unit Testing** - Developer testing
- **Integration Testing** - Module interaction
- **System Testing** - End-to-end scenarios
- **UAT** - User acceptance testing
- **Performance Testing** - Load and stress
- **Security Testing** - Vulnerability assessment
- **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG compliance

### Test Automation
- Automation pyramid (unit, integration, E2E)
- Framework selection (Selenium, Cypress, Playwright)
- CI/CD integration
- Flaky test prevention
- Maintenance strategies

### Defect Management
- Severity and priority classification
- Root cause analysis
- Trend analysis and reporting
- Metrics (escape rate, defect density)
- Closing the loop

### Tools & Frameworks
- **Selenium** - Web automation
- **Cypress** - Modern E2E testing
- **Jest** - Unit testing framework
- **TestNG/JUnit** - Java testing
- **Postman** - API testing
- **JMeter** - Performance testing

## QA Metrics

- **Defect density** - Defects per KLOC
- **Escape rate** - Defects found in production
- **Test coverage** - % of code/features tested
- **Test effectiveness** - Defects caught by QA
- **Time to fix** - Average resolution time

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Testing

- Automated test execution in pipelines
- Test reporting and dashboards
- Failure notifications
- Performance trend analysis

## Quality Assurance Maturity

- Level 1: Ad-hoc testing
- Level 2: Structured testing
- Level 3: Risk-based testing
- Level 4: Automated testing
- Level 5: Continuous quality

## Common Challenges

- Balancing speed and quality
- Automating the right tests
- Flaky test prevention
- Keeping automation maintainable
- Shifting quality left
- Tool selection and ROI

## Leadership Responsibilities

- Setting quality standards
- Building QA team
- Mentoring QA engineers
- Quality metrics and reporting
- Process improvement
- Vendor/tool management
