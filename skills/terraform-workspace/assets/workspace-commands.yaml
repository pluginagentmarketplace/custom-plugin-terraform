commands:
  list: "terraform workspace list"
  new: "terraform workspace new dev"
  select: "terraform workspace select prod"
  show: "terraform workspace show"
  delete: "terraform workspace delete staging"
best_practices:
  - Use workspaces for environment separation
  - Name workspaces after environments (dev, staging, prod)
  - Use terraform.workspace in configurations
