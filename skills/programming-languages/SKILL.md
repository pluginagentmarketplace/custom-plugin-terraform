# Programming Languages

## Quick Start

```python
# Python - Beginner friendly
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# JavaScript - Web everywhere
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

# Go - Fast and concurrent
func greet(name string) string {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"
}
```
